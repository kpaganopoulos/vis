• The data set is large and will probably not open well in Excel, so you will need to load the CSV file into R or another platform of your choice (e.g. Python) 
• It is up to your team to decide which datasets to use (choice of city/cities, and calendar/reviews/listings data) 
Data wrangling and transformation
• Keep a record of your process so that the analysis is reproducible 
Find a story 
• Explore the story and make sure it is true and insightful 
• You can make a story around a business argument. It is up to you to decide your audience. 
Create visualisation and refine 
• You must present at least 3 different chart types (i.e. don’t just make 3 scatter plots in report) 
• Consider Why, How, and What of data visualisation from the lecture
